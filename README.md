Just left the theater, and honestly, I can't decide if Death of a Unicorn was an existential masterpiece or a dumpster fire. The whole thing is swirling around in my head like a cheap cocktail. Imagine cramming a fantasy, horror, and a touch of 'what-on-earth-am-I-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨' all into two hours. My brain feels like it's been through the wash. But wow, what a ride. If I could high-five confusion, I would.

Is it weird that I found myself rooting for the villain halfway through? Don't get me wrong, the protagonist was cool—I guess—but there's something about a unicorn-obsessed antagonist that keeps the gears grinding. At one point, I thought, is this a metaphor for my last relationship or just an incoherent plot twist? Hard to tell.

By the way, if a unicorn screams in the forest and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Yes, according to this  , and it's surprisingly soothing. Like if ASMR and a bear roar had a baby. Whoever dreamed up this plot was either a genius or running on pure caffeine and two hours of sleep. 

At times, I wondered if the writers threw darts at a storyboard. Let's make the unicorn... uh, explode? Sure, why not. And yet, somehow all this thrown spaghetti stuck to the wall and made a kinda interesting pattern. It’s like they dared us to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later just to fully comprehend the chaos. Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? Maybe once my head stops spinning.

So yeah, walking out, I'm not sure what I expected to come blooming from Death of a Unicorn, but maybe sprouting a whole bunch of questions in my head was the point? Did I dig it? Let's say yes, but more like a reluctant 'yes' you give at family dinners when asked if you want more salad. Will I recommend it? Probably, if only because I want to see other people make sense of that madness. Or maybe, I'll leave it to ferment in my brain and then revisit to see if it becomes wine or just vinegar.
